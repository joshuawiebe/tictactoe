# Project Notes: Perfect Tic Tac Toe App

## Vision
- Create the most modern, beautiful, and intuitive Tic Tac Toe app for mobile and desktop.
- Face-to-face play: board centered, scoreboard slanted and readable from both sides, turn indicator appears on the current player's side.
- Bot mode: wild, futuristic AI animation when bot is thinking.
- Unified design: all screens (menu, settings, game) use the same style, colors, and iconography.
- Full keyboard accessibility and mobile polish.

## Design Principles
- Only custom SVG icons, no emojis.
- Responsive layout for all devices.
- Seamless transitions and delightful animations.
- Accessibility: keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, focus rings.
- Easy to maintain and extend.

## Technical Stack
- React (functional components, hooks)
